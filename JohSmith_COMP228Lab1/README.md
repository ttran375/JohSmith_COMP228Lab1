Due Date: Week 3

References: Learning materials for week 1, 2, textbook, and other
references (if any)

Purpose: The purpose of this Lab assignment is to:

- Practice the use Java classes, Java methods, and other concepts
  taught.

This material provides the necessary information you need to complete
the exercises.

Be sure to read the following general instructions carefully:

> This lab should be completed individually by all the students.
>
> YOU NEED TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING 2 DOCUMENTS IN THE DROPBOX TITLED
> LAB1:

1.  THE FIRST ONE IS A WORD DOCUMENT. USE THIS DOCUMENT AS YOUR FIRST
    DELIVERABLE. DO NOT DELETE THE INSTRUCTIONS OR QUESTIONS. AT THE END
    OF THIS DOCUMENT SIMPLY ADD SCREEN SHOTS OF THE RUNNING STATE OF
    EACH EXERCISE (If there are more than 1 exercise). THE SCREEN SHOTS
    SHOULD COVER ALL THE ASPECTS/FUNCTIONALITIES OF EACH EXERCISE (If
    there are more than 1 exercise).. AFTER THE SCREEN SHOTS PLEASE COPY
    THE CODE FROM THE CODE WINDOW AND PASTE THE COMPLETE CODE. DO NOT
    GIVE ME THE SCREEN SHOTS OF THE CODE. DO NOT ZIP THIS FILE AND KEEP
    IT SEPARATE FROM YOUR ZIPPED PROGAM FOLDER.

2.  SUBMIT ALSO ONE ZIPPED PROJECT FOLDER/FILE THAT CONTAINS ALL THE
    EXERISES (If there are more than 1 exercise) SEPARATELY INTO THE
    SAME DROP BOX.

You must name your Eclipse/IntelliJ project according to the following
rule:

**YourFullName_COMP228Labnumber**

Example: **JohSmith_COMP228Lab1**

Each exercise should be placed in a separate package named *exercise1*,
*exercise2*, etc.

Submit your assignment in a **zip file** that is named according to the
following rule:

**YourLastName_COMP228Labnumber.zip**

Example: **JohSmith_COMP228Lab1.zip**

Apply the naming conventions for variables, methods, classes, and
packages:

\- *variable names* start with a *lowercase* character

\- *classes* start with an *uppercase* character

\- **packages** use only *lowercase* characters

\- *methods* start with a *lowercase* character

**<u>Exercise 1:</u>**

Write a Java application that creates a Java console application to keep
records of singers and displays stored record. Follow the following
instructions to develop the application:

Create a class named Singers with the following specifications:

- 5 instance variables that would store the following singer data (Use
  recommended variable naming conventions and appropriate data type for
  each instance variable):

  - Singer’s id

  - Singer’s name

  - Singer’s address

  - Date of birth

  - Number of albums published

- Two constructors that would allow you to construct Singer object with
  no arguments and 5 arguments.

- Create Setters and getters for all the instance variables of class
  Singer. Make sure to have several setters that would allow you to set
  the values of individual instance variables of the singer object. Also
  create one setter that would allow you to set all the values of the
  instance variables at once. Create several getters that would allow
  you to get the current individual values of each instance variables of
  the Singer object.

- Create the driver class that would create 1 Singer (singer1) object
  with the help of the no argument constructor. Display the default
  values of the instance variables of this object singer1.

- Set the values of each instance variables with the help of the setter
  that sets all the values. Display the values.

- Now change the value of each instance variable using setter for each
  instance variable. Display current value of each after the changes are
  done. Use getters for each to accomplish this.
