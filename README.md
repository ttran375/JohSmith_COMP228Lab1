[![Style Check](https://github.com/ttran375/JohSmith_COMP228Lab1/actions/workflows/stylecheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ttran375/JohSmith_COMP228Lab1/actions/workflows/stylecheck.yml)

You must name your Eclipse/IntelliJ project according to the following
rule:

**YourFullName_COMP228Labnumber**

Example: **JohSmith_COMP228Lab1**

Each exercise should be placed in a separate package named *exercise1*,
*exercise2*, etc.

Submit your assignment in a **zip file** that is named according to the
following rule:

**YourLastName_COMP228Labnumber.zip**

Example: **JohSmith_COMP228Lab1.zip**

Apply the naming conventions for variables, methods, classes, and
packages:

\- *variable names* start with a *lowercase* character

\- *classes* start with an *uppercase* character

\- **packages** use only *lowercase* characters

\- *methods* start with a *lowercase* character

**<u>Exercise 1:</u>**

Write a Java application that creates a Java console application to keep
records of singers and displays stored record. Follow the following
instructions to develop the application:

Create a class named Singers with the following specifications:

- 5 instance variables that would store the following singer data (Use
  recommended variable naming conventions and appropriate data type for
  each instance variable):

  - Singer’s id

  - Singer’s name

  - Singer’s address

  - Date of birth

  - Number of albums published

- Two constructors that would allow you to construct Singer object with
  no arguments and 5 arguments.

- Create Setters and getters for all the instance variables of class
  Singer. Make sure to have several setters that would allow you to set
  the values of individual instance variables of the singer object. Also
  create one setter that would allow you to set all the values of the
  instance variables at once. Create several getters that would allow
  you to get the current individual values of each instance variables of
  the Singer object.

- Create the driver class that would create 1 Singer (singer1) object
  with the help of the no argument constructor. Display the default
  values of the instance variables of this object singer1.

- Set the values of each instance variables with the help of the setter
  that sets all the values. Display the values.

- Now change the value of each instance variable using setter for each
  instance variable. Display current value of each after the changes are
  done. Use getters for each to accomplish this.
